                <h3>Who we are...</h3>
                <p>A Christ-Centered outreach ministry devoted to encouraging, empowering, equipping, and inspiring the community through the Word of God. By doing so, individuals will develop a personal relationship with Him.</p>

                <h3>What we do...</h3>
                <p>With a unified goal of bringing more souls to Christ, we sponsor and create opportunities for the community to connect and share the word of God. We partner with local businesses, community advocates, churches, and other faith based ministry organizations to facilitate seminars and classes, retreats, talent showcases, community events, and conferences.</p>
                
                <p>The ministry is active in the community with volunteers ministering to youth detention centers, battered women shelters, and partnering with licensed professional mental health counselors.</p>
                
                <p>We are in the planning stages of our annual Count it All Joy conference, that is an opportunity for the entire family to come and experience praise and worship, empowerment seminars, and a relevant word from our invited speakers.</p>
                
                <p>4 His Glory Ministries (4HGM) is excited about the upcoming 5 on 5 Community Basketball Tournament and Barbecue, the "This Means War, Prayer Retreat", Domestic Violence Awareness Benefit, and other outreach initiatives.</p>

                <h3>Why we do it</h3>
                <p>4 His Glory Ministries is on fire for God. Everything we do is to glorify Him. There are many souls that need to be saved!</p>
